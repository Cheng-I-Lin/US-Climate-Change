            The <a href="https://www.dkrz.de/en/communication/climate-simulations/cmip6-en/the-ssp-scenarios">SSP245</a> 
            situation represents a <strong>medium</strong> pathway for future

            situation represents a <strong>high</strong> pathway for future

          <h2>Scenario Comparison</h2>
          <p>
            When we compare the two scenarios (TAS of SSP585 minus TAS of SSP245) we see that 
            <ul>
                <li>Overall average increase of <em>1.86°C</em> (an increase of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/degrees-matter"><em>1.5°C</em></a> results in severe climate change impacts)</li>

          <h2>Environmental Consequences</h2>
          <p>
            Let's now explore the notable climate impacts caused by increasing temperatures, in which we would 
            specifically focus on the following variables:
            <ul>
                <li>Near surface temperature (°C)</li>
                <li>Precipitation (mm)</li>
                <li>Snowfall (mm)</li>
                <li>Soil moisture content (mm)</li>
            </ul>
            By doing so, we can visualize how emission levels can lead to global warming that can
            thus perpetrate climate change related crises.

        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Northern States</h2>
            <p>
              If we take a closer look, we can notice a pronounced pattern exhibited by the northern states, 
              in which when temperature rises:
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation increases steadily</li>
                  <li>Snowfall decreases drastically</li>
                  <li>Soil moisture drops slightly or remains relatively similar</li>
              </ul>

        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Northern States: Trendlines</h2>
            <p>
              These trends become apparant when graphed, showing how temperature, precipitation, snow fall, and
              soil moisture changes as the years go by.

        </div>

        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Southern States</h2>
            <p>
              For the southern states, we notice the opposite pattern when temperature rises:
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation drops steadily in an oscillitating manner (sometimes declines more, sometimes declines less)</li>
                  <li>Snowfall still decreases drastically</li>
                  <li>Soil moisture decreases slightly</li>

        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Northeastern States</h2>
            <p>
              Another interesting pattern we discovered is the ones shown by northeastern states, 
              in which when temperature rises:
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation increases steadily</li>
                  <li>Snowfall still decreases drastically</li>

            <h2>Exception States</h2>
            <p>
              However, there are a few states that do not possess any of the aforementioned patterns, or simplay
              does not have matching patterns with those of the previous three regions in terms of their 
              geographical locations. Keep scrolling to find out more.

        <div class="textContainer">
          <h2>New Mexico</h2>
          <p>
            The interesting thing about New Mexico is that although it is a southern state, it possesses the trends of
            northern states in which when temperature rises: 
            <ul>
                <li>Precipitation increases steadily</li>
                <li>Snowfall decreases drastically</li>
                <li>Soil moisture drops slightly or remains relatively similar</li>

            <h2>South Carolina</h2>
            <p>
              Similar to New Mexico, South Carolina also exhibits an unique trend despite being in the southern 
              part of the United States. In this case, when temerature rises: 
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation steadily increases with oscillating behavior</li>
                  <li>Snowfall remains relatively unchanged, oscillating around the mean of <em>-0.2</em> mm</li>

            <h2>Florida</h2>
            <p>
              As one of the most popular southern states, Florida yields some shocking results. Unlike its southern 
              peers, when temperature rises in Florida: 
              <ul>
                  <li>Snowfall remains relatively unchanged, oscillating around the mean of <em>-0.11</em> mm</li>

        <div class="textContainer">
            <h2>Georgia</h2>
            <p>
             Interestingly, Georgia exhibits an unique trend of oscillitating values for all three variables, in which: 
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation and soil moisture oscillitate between positive (increase) and negative (decrease) values</li>
                  <li>Snowfall slightly decreases but with oscillating behavior as well</li>

            Although Rhode Island is located in the northeastern region of the United States, it does not portray the
            phenomenon of increasing precipitation and soil moisture like its neighboring states. Instead, Rhode Island
            has the following behaviors: 
            <ul>
                <li>Precipitation slightly increases with oscillating behavior</li>
                <li>Snowfall slightly decreases but with oscillating behavior as well</li>

              Another exception in the northeastern region is Delaware. Even though it's soil moisture rises, 
              its precipitation and snowfall behaved differently: 
              <ul>
                  <li>Precipitation remains relatively unchanged, oscillating around the mean of <em>-15.07</em> mm</li>

              Since Tennessee is pretty much in the middle section of the United States, it possesses traits from all three 
              northern, southern, and northeastern regions.
